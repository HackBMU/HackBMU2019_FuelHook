Fuel Hook is an IOT based comprehensive vehicle fuel monitoring system. 
The device accurately tracks the fuel transactions/exchanges taking place within the vehicle. 
This helps the user identify fuel theft occurring during refills and otherwise. 
This involves a systematic approach which includes measuring the fuel 
supplied to the automobile and comparing it with the self-proclaimed readings of the distributor. 
The system compares the readings instantaneously and provides the consumer with the amount of stolen fuel.
We intend to keep track of the GPS location of the times when the consumer refills his/her vehicle. 
This way the user will be able to access the exact location as well.
